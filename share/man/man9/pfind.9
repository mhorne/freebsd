.Sh NAME
.Nm pfind ,
.Nm pfind_any
.Nd locate a process by numeric ID
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/proc.h
.Ft "struct proc *"
.Fn pfind "pid_t pid"
.Ft "struct proc *"
.Fn pfind_any "pid_t pid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pfind
function walks the list of processes in the system, looking for the one with a
process ID of
.Fa pid .
If the process exists, and is not in the zombie state, a pointer to the process
structure will be returned.
.Pp
The
.Fn pfind_any
function behaves identically to
.Fn pfind ,
except that the lookup does not exclude processes in the zombie state.
.Pp
Both
.Fn pfind
and
.Fn pfind_any
lock the returned process using
.Fn PROC_LOCK "p" .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn pfind
and
.Fn pfind_any
return a pointer to a
.Vt struct proc
after a successful lookup, and
.Dv NULL
otherwise.
